## About

- The project is used for educational purposes only, its part of the lesson i took from Jonas.
- As part of my learnings and would benefit me, I've listed down here **(See features section)** all the PSEUDO Code, SUMMARY and features from this project

## Concepts/Takeaway
- The project uses CSS Grid as the main tool to configure all the layout, it gives the ability to define its layout easily by setting its template row and column.
- Functions such as minmax, repeat ana property min-content, max-content, auto-fit and auto-fill gives a responsive layout which make life easier when building media queries
- Gridception are applicable, what i mean by griception is nesting grid inside a grid and so on.
- Naming of grid lines/area are useful especially when you are about to write media-queries. like instead of redefining its line number all over across the sass we can dont need to exert much effort since it was configure with name already.
